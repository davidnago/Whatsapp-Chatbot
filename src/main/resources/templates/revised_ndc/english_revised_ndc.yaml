    title: "Zimbabwe's NDC"
    body: "What are NDCs?\n\n
    NDCs are national climate plans that outline a country's goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. Zimbabwe's NDC includes targets for reducing emissions, increasing renewable energy, and enhancing climate resilience
    . The NDC is a key tool for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and addressing climate change.\n\n 
    Revised NDC\n
    Zimbabwe is committed to playing its part in tackling climate change. Our recently revised NDCs reflect a significant increase in ambition compared to our previous submission.\n
    1st NDC (2015): Targeted a 33% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on the energy sector.\n
    Current NDC: Sets a more ambitious target of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across the entire economy.\n
    This demonstrates Zimbabwe's dedication to reducing its carbon footprint and building a more sustainable future."
